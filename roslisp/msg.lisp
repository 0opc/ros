(defmacro with-fields (bindings m &body body)
  "with-fields BINDINGS MSG &rest BODY

A macro for convenient access to message fields.

BINDINGS is an unevaluated list of bindings.  Each binding is like a let binding (FOO BAR), where FOO is a symbol naming a variable that will be bound to the field value.  BAR describes the field.  In the simplest case it's just a symbol naming the field.  It can also be a list, e.g. (QUX GAR).  This means the field QUX of the field GAR of the message.  Finally, the entire binding can be a symbol FOO, which is a shorthand for (FOO FOO).  
MSG evaluates to a message.
BODY is the body, surrounded by an implicit progn.

As an example, instead of (let ((foo (pkg:foo-val (pkg:bar-val m)))
      (baz (pkg:baz-val m)))
  (stuff)) 

you can use (with-fields ((foo (foo bar)) baz)
		(stuff))"

(defmacro make-message (msg-type &rest args)
  "make-message MSG-TYPE &rest ARGS

Convenience macro for creating messages easily.

MSG-TYPE is a string naming a message ros datatype.

ARGS is a list of form FIELD-SPEC1 VAL1 ... FIELD-SPECk VALk
Each FIELD-SPEC (unevaluated) is a list (or a symbol, which designates a list of one element) that refers to a possibly nested field.
VAL is the corresponding value.

For example, if MSG-TYPE is the string robot_msgs/Pose, and ARGS are (x position) 42 (w orientation) 1
this will create a Pose with the x field of position equal to 42 and the w field of orientation equal to 1 (other fields equal their default values)."
